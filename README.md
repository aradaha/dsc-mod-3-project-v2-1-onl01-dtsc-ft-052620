In this project, I classified Tanzanian wells accrding to many dimensions.

First, I did a test train split with the data. I split both the test and train data so I could perform functions on them at the same time.

Then a created several functions which made everything easier for me to do.

The first one I used was a function that gave statistics on each type of model. It timed how long it took each to train and to test, and gave their accuracy, and a confusion matrix for me to look at.

I looked at that data and decided that random forest was the way to go, so I tried tweaking it to improve the accuracy, but was ultimately unsuccessful.

I also made two types of maps of the tanzanian wells. One in 3d, the other 2d. The 2d one looks better.
